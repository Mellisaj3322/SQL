In this project,I'd like to show you how to use alter, update and delete in SQL by using the data from CashApp

#1 we craeted the table and inserted te data sets *****
CREATE TABLE CashApp (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Name TEXT,
    Date TEXT,
    Amount INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO CashApp (Name,Date,Amount) Values ("Destiny", "2022-07-13",195);
INSERT INTO CashApp (Name,Date,Amount) Values ("Zoe", "2022-08-21",335);
INSERT INTO CashApp (Name,Date,Amount) Values ("Katie", "2022-09-01",73);
 SELECT * FROM CashApp;
 
 
 
#2 I used "ALTER"  to add the Instant_deposit column into the table
ALTER TABLE CashApp ADD Instant_Deposit TEXT;
SELECT * FROM CashApp;
 
 
 
 #3 I used "UPDATE" to input additional data into the instant_deposit column
UPDATE CashApp SET Instant_Deposit = 'yes' WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE CashApp SET Instant_Deposit = 'no' WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE CashApp SET Instant_Deposit = 'yes' WHERE id = 3;
SELECT * FROM CashApp;


#4 Iused "DELETE" to remove the row that I dont want it to display in the table
DELETE FROM CashApp WHERE id = 2;
SELECT * FROM CashApp;
