For this project, I would like to show you what I have written SQL codes from 'Chinook' Database as its my final project

#1 Display all the album names of the artist "Deep Purple"
SELECT art.name,alb.title 
FROM chinook.artists  art
JOIN chinook.albums alb 
ON art.artistid = alb.artistid
WHERE art.name = 'Deep Purple'


#2 How many customers are there who live in Canada?
SELECT count(country)FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Canada'

#3 Display the customers who use gmail accounts
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM chinook.customers
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com%'

#4 Display the customer name list whose their sales agent is "Margaret Park" 
SELECT emp.lastname AS " SalesAgent", cust.firstname, cust.lastname
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
WHERE emp.lastname like '%Park%'
