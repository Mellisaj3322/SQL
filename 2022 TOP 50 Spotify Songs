## In this project,I downloaded the Spotify top 50 songs in 2021 data from the website "Kaggle" 
### and created the table for inserting the data in SQLiteStudio 
### and came up with some questions that could be possibly analyzed using SQL skills


***** Step 1 : Creating the table ******

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
(id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

***** Step 2 : Inserting Spotify Data *****

I imported the Spotify data file from Kaggle into the SQLite Studio and made sure it is CSV file in data source type
and started to query the table.

***** Step 3 : Creating analytics questions and writing SQL codes *****

Question (1) : Who are the top 5 artists based on their popularities?
SELECT artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc limit 5

Question (2) : What song is the most energetic?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, energy FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
ORDER BY energy desc LIMIT 1

Question (3) : What song has the least danceability?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, min(danceability)FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData

Question (4) : How many Doja Cat songs are there in this chart?
SELECT artist_name , COUNT(track_name)AS total_songs FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'

Question (5) : What song has the key of C ?
(Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. 
E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on)
SELECT track_name, artist_name, key FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE key= 0

Question (6) : Which artist name displayed more than 1 time in the chart?
SELECT artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name HAVING COUNT(*)>= 2

Question (7): How could you show the artist names with the average popularity that is 90 or above and add the 'top star' tag?
### using a CTE (Coomon Table Expression)###
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS
(SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity)
AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90
