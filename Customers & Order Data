In this SQL project, I would like to show some examples of the codes I've written from the database "customers and order data"


(1) How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 

(2) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone'

(3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT  acctnum 
from BIT_DB. customers cust 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
