In this SQL project, I would like to show some examples of the codes I've written from the database "customers and order data"


(1) How many orders were placed in February?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 



(2) How many of those orders were for Wired Headphones in January?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product = 'Wired Headphones'


(3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT acctnum 
from BIT_DB. customers cust 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid

(4)Which product was sold the chepest in May and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.MaySales 
ORDER BY price asc limit 1

(5) What is the total revenue of each product sold in April?
SELECT SUM(quantity)* price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.AprSales GROUP BY product


(6) which product was sold at 459 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94016 in January, how many were sold and what was the revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity), 
sum(quantity)*price As revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location =  '459 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94016'

(7)How many customers ordered more than 5 products at a time in January, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
On jan.orderid= cust.order_ID
WHERE jan.quantity > 5
